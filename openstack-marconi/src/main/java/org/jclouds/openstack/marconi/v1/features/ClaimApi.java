    * This operation claims a set of messages (up to the value of the limit parameter) from oldest to newest and skips
    * any messages that are already claimed. If no unclaimed messages are available, an empty List is returned.
    * </p>
    * When a client (worker) finishes processing a message, it should delete the message before the claim expires to
    * ensure that the message is processed only once. As part of the delete operation, workers should specify the claim
    * ID. If workers perform these actions and a claim simply expires, the server can return an error and notify the
    * worker of the race condition. This action gives the worker a chance to roll back its own processing of the given
    * message because another worker can claim the message and process it.
    * </p>
    * The age given for a claim is relative to the server's clock. The claim's age is useful for determining how
    * quickly messages are getting processed and whether a given message's claim is about to expire.
    * </p>
    * When a claim expires, it is released. If the original worker failed to process the message, another client worker
    * can then claim the message.
    * </p>
    * Note that claim creation is best-effort, meaning the worker may claim and return less than the requested number
    * of messages.
    * </p>
    * To deal with workers that have stopped responding (for up to 1209600 seconds or 14 days, including claim
    * lifetime), the server extends the lifetime of claimed messages to be at least as long as the lifetime of the
    * claim itself, plus the specified grace period. If a claimed message would normally live longer than the grace
    * period, its expiration is not adjusted.
    *
    * @param ttl   The TTL attribute specifies how long the server waits before releasing the claim. The ttl value
    *              must be between 60 and 43200 seconds (12 hours). You must include a value for this attribute in
    *              your request.
    * @param grace The grace value specifies the message grace period in seconds. The value of grace value must
    *              be between 60 and 43200 seconds (12 hours). You must include a value for this attribute in your
    *              request.
    * @param limit Specifies the number of messages to return, up to 20 messages.
